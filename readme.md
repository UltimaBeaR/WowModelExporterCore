work in progress...

set of tools to convert world of warcraft characters to vrchat avatars

it works by getting data from wowhead and doing same thing wowhead's 3d model viewer does to render wow characters in browser, but it converts it to .fbx models and textures rather than just rendering.

it also has some post process options for making it fit to unity3d and vrchat requirments for avatar model.
